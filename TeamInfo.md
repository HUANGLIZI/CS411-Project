## Project Summary

Nowadays, more and more travelers want to live in local houses instead of hotels for accommodation, this makes short period house renting popular. However, there still exists problems in these renting services. To make the travel experience better and safer, we would like to create a website which provides convenience for both tenants and landlords.

This website is a house rental website, which provides convenience for tenants to rent houses, and allows landlords to rent houses. This system provides options for long-term rental and short-term rental, and tenants can choose houses with different rental periods. This system has The co-tenancy function allows tenants to choose suitable co-tenant roommates online according to their preferences. This system has a credit point mechanism to evaluate landlords and tenants.

Our system's database will include information about tenants, landlords, houses, cities, most of which come from public real data, providing authenticity to our system.
